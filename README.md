# DMPA
Open-source data for trajectory simulation of Drag-Modulated Plasma Aerocapture

## Background
This data is generated from the analytical plasma model of a magnetoshell interacting with a rarefied hypersonic atmospheric flow.  It accompanies the following paper, a .pdf of which is in this repository.

[1] _Kelly, C. L., & Little, J. M. (2021). Performance and Design Scaling of Magnetoshells for Outer Planet Drag-Modulated Plasma Aerocapture. In IEEE Aerospace Conference. Virtual Event._

## How to use this data
The data is provided as a .csv file.  Each row contains a set of input parameters to the model and an output value of effective drag area.  The effective drag area is defined in Equation (3) of [1].
